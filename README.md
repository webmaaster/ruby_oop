# ruby_oop
Ruby is one of the popular programming languages. Ruby was developed to make programming simple.


## OOP is programming paradigm that deals with OBJECTS and their INTERACTIONS to design & program applications

## Thing: Object - created from a Class or 'Blueprint'
### - Features of 'thing' - 'attributes' of the object, specified in the Class

## Example:
### Teacher => Class
### - Name, Email, Username, Password => attributes of the teacher

### Course => Class
### - course_name, course_id, course_description => attributes

- OOP allows the program to block off areas of code that perform certain tasks independently of other areas in the application.

Four main pillars of OOP concept are:

Encapsulation: 
Concept of blocking off areas of code and not making it available to the rest of the program

Abstraction: 
Is simplifying a complex process of a program, an enterprise software solution for example by modeling classes appropriate for it

Inheritance:
 Is used where a class inherits the behavior of another class, referred to as the superclass

Polymorphism:
 Is when a class inherits the behaviors of another class, but has the ability to not inherit everything and change some of itâ€™s inherited behaviors. For example to write a method that does something differently from the inherited method

Classes:
 It is a blueprint that describes the state and behavior that the objects of the class all share. A class can be used to create many objects. Objects created at runtime from a class are called instances of that particular class.

Example of a user class:

class Teacher
    attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name, :username, :email, :password

    def initialize(firstname, lastname, username, email, password)
        @first_name = firstname
        @last_name = lastname
        @username = username
        @email =email
        @password = password

    end 


    def to_s
        "First name: #{@first_name}, Last name: #{@last_name}, Username: #{@username}, Email address: #{@email}, Password: #{@password}"
    end 

end 

masud = Teacher.new("Masudur", "Chawdhury", "masud", 
                   "masud@gmail.com", "admin1")
babu = Teacher.new("Babul D", "Nokrek", "babu", 
                   "babu@gmail.com", "admin2")


puts masud
puts babu 

puts "Masud is altered!"
masud.last_name = babu.last_name
puts masud
